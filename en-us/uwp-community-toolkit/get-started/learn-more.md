#UWP Community Toolkit Source Code
We recommend visiting the [UWP Community Toolkit Github Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit) to see the current state of the project, what is coming next, and to clone the repository.  Community contributions are welcome!

##Toolkit Sample App
The UWP Community Toolkit does not have a local installer.  If you want to see the controls and animations in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Toolkit Sample Application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows store.  Download the app and play with the controls to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.
