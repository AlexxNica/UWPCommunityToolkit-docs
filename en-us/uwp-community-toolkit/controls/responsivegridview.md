# ResponsiveGridView XAML Control 
The **ResponsiveGridView Control** presents content within a *Grid View* to fill the total available display space. It reacts to changes in both content and the layout, so it can adapt to different form factors automatically.

## Syntax
```xaml
<controls:ResponsiveGridView  Name="ResponsiveGridViewControl"
          ItemHeight="200"
          DesiredWidth="300"
          ItemTemplate="{StaticResource PhotosTemplate}">
</controls:ResponsiveGridView>
```
