    <h1>Windows 10 Store Sample App</h1>
    Want to see the controls and behaviors in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Toolkit Sample Application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.

    <h2>Documentation / Samples</h2>
    We also recommend visiting the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit">UWP Community Toolkit Github Repository</a> to see the current state of the project, what is coming next, and to clone the repository.  Community contributions are welcome!

    <h3>Nuget packages</h3>
    Visit the <a href="en-us/uwp-commmunity-toolkit/get-started/nugetpackages.htm">Nuget packages page</a> to see what is included and how to get them into your project.

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Principle #1: As soon as a comparable toolkit control or a service is available in official SDK, we will plan to mark it as deprecated</li>
        <li>Principle #2: We want to keep the toolkit useful and not bloated with too specific services that will become hard to maintain</li>
        <li>Principle #3: All controls / services are supported for 2 Windows SDK release cycles or until another Principle supersedes it.</li>
    </ol>
