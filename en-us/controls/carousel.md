# Carousel Menu
The <b> Carousel Control </b>
is a slide-like application that allows users to add an interactive navigation, both horizotal and vertical, user interface 
to their applications. You can navigate through a list, add and remove items dynamically, smooth animations and transition.  
The Carousel control is responsive by design, optimizing the visualization in the different form factors.
