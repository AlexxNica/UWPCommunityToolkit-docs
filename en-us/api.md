## Getting Started

Read the [getting Started with the UWP Community Toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/getting-started.htm) for instructions on using these API functions in your own projects. 

## Windows 10 Store App

Want to see the controls and animations in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Community Toolkit Sample App](http://aka.ms/uwptoolkitapp) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.

## GitHub Repository

Visit the [UWP Community Toolkit Github Repository](http://aka.ms/uwptoolkit) to see the current source code, what is coming next, and to clone the repository.  Community contributions are welcome!
