## Windows 10 Store App

Want to see the controls and animations in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Community Toolkit Sample App](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.
