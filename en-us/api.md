UWP Community Toolkit API
=========================

## Getting Started using the toolkit

Read the [getting Started with the UWP Toolkit]({{site.baseurl}}/{{page.lang}}/get-started/get-started.htm) for instructions on using these API functions in your own projects. 

### Windows 10 Store App

Want to see the controls and animations in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Toolkit Sample Application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.

### Documentation / Samples

We also recommend visiting the [UWP Community Toolkit Github Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit) to see the current state of the project, what is coming next, and to clone the repository.  Community contributions are welcome!
