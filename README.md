UWP Community Toolkit Documentation
=========================

# Getting Started
[Getting Started with the UWP Toolkit](en-us/uwp-community-toolkit/get-started/get-started.md)

### Windows 10 Store App
Want to see the controls and animations in action before jumping into the code?  We have published the [UWP Toolkit Sample Application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4tlcq) to the Windows 10 store.  Download the app and play with the controls live to see what they do before ever writing a line of code.

### Documentation / Samples
We also recommend visiting the [UWP Community Toolkkit Github Repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPCommunityToolkit) to see the current state of the project, what is coming next, and to clone the repository.  Community contributions are welcome!

# NuGet packages
Visit the [NuGet packages](en-us/uwp-community-toolkit/get-started/nugetpackages.md) page to see what is included and how to get them into your project.

## Principles
 - Principle #1: As soon as a comparable toolkit control or a service is available in official SDK, we will plan to mark it as deprecated
 - Principle #2: We want to keep the toolkit useful and not bloated with too specific services that will become hard to maintain
 - Principle #3: All controls / services are supported for 2 Windows SDK release cycles or until another Principle supersedes it.
